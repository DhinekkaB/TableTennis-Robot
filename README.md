## **Testing of TTBot**

In TTBot, we use three kinds of motors:
1. **3 BLDC motors**
2. **Servo motor**
3. **DC motor** *(Initially we used a stepper motor, later replaced by a DC motor)*

We started by testing each motor individually.

---

## **BLDC Motor**
> *Used for launching the ball*

- Tested the BLDC motor to determine its maximum and minimum speeds.  
  ‚û§ **[1DCworking.ino]**

- After successful individual testing, integrated the other two BLDC motors and tested all together.  
  ‚û§ **[2DCworking.ino]**

- Different speeds were configured, allowing continuous operation at constant speed.  
  ‚û§ **[bldc1fixed.ino]**

‚úÖ **Result:** All BLDC motors are functioning perfectly.

---

## **Servo Motor**
> *Used to change the angle of launching*

- Integrated with BLDC and tested using fixed speed & angle values.  
  ‚û§ **[DCServoFixedworking.ino]**

- Later tested with manual instructions via ROS.  
  ‚û§ **[bldc_servomanual.ino]**

---

## **Stepper Motor**
> *Used to push the ball from the reservoir to the launcher*

- Initial testing was done standalone.  
  ‚û§ **[StepperAlone.ino]**

- After success, integrated with BLDC and Servo motors.

---

## **Integrating All Motors**

- Tested motor integration with fixed values.  
  ‚û§ **[Fixed3motor.ino]**

- Then tested with manual serial monitor commands.  
  ‚û§ **[Manual3motor.ino]**

- Also enabled control via ROS.  
  ‚û§ **[manual5motor.ino]**

- Developed Python script for user-controlled input to drive motors.  
  ‚û§ **[5motor_pythonscriptROS.ino]**, **[motor_controller.py]**

## **Final Part: Spin Generation for Table Tennis Practice**

Spin control is key for realistic training. We:

- Created 10 different speed sets.
- Used ROS to select a random set based on user command.  
  ‚û§ **[spincoderos.ino]**

---

## **Automatic Instructions**

- Initially, BLDC speeds were entered manually (e.g., 1000‚Äì2000).
- Developed an intuitive input system:
  - `'f'` ‚Üí forward spin
  - `'b'` ‚Üí backward spin
  - `'s'` ‚Üí side spin
  - `'stop'` ‚Üí reset to initial position

Each spin type uses randomized speed sets, with top-spin increasing by 200 within its range.

- Python script handles these operations.
- Stepper motor was later replaced by DC motor for better performance.
